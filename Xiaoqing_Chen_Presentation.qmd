## Are current property tax assessments in Philadelphia fair and accurate?

::::: columns
::: column
Property taxes depend on OPA’s assessed values.\

Assessments often deviate from actual sale prices.\

Some areas are consistently over- or under-assessed.\

Unequal assessments create unfair tax burdens.

Accuracy, Uniformity & Equity of Philadelphia’s 2023 Real Estate
Assessments</em> (Apr 2024). ]{style="font-size:0.9em; color:#475569;"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Motivations

Fairness: Ensure residents pay taxes aligned with true property values.

Transparency: Build trust through objective, data-based methods.

Efficiency: Improve city revenue stability and policy planning.

Traditional assessments rely on outdated, manual approaches.

Machine learning models can better capture local market dynamics.

## Larger homes, higher neighborhood income, and more bathrooms increase prices — while older properties tend to sell for less. {.tiny}

## Adding more real-world data to build a more fair and accurate housing price model {.tiny}

- M1: Basic home features (size, age) → simple but
limited\
- M2: + Census data → adds community context\
- M3: + Spatial data → captures location effects\
- M4: + Interactions → reflects real neighborhood differences

![](images/ols_4model_performance.png){width="100%" fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Home size and bathrooms remain important across all models, while neighborhood and location features gain influence after improving.

**Observations** - Structural features (bathrooms, livable area) stay
top-ranked across all models\
- Socioeconomic and spatial factors (income, census tract) rise in
importance as they’re added\
- Final model shows *location effects* becoming dominant predictors of
price

![](images/feature_importance_lollipop_v2.png){width="100%" fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Model Performance: The predicted prices from our final model align strongly with actual sales.

Our approach can reliably estimate market values across neighborhoods.

![](images/spatial_prediction_comparison.png){width="100%"}
![](images/model_performance_table.png){width="100%"} \>“Average Error
(\$)” shows the average gap between predicted and actual prices (lower =
more accurate).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The map highlights neighborhoods where predicted prices differ most from actual sales.

These areas, shown in deep red or blue, are likely where property
assessments are least accurate, and where tax fairness may be at
greatest risk.

![](images/spatial_prediction_residuals.png){width="40%"}
**Interpretation** - **Blue areas:** Homes undervalued by the model →
may face *under-assessment*\
- **Red areas:** Homes overvalued → may face *over-assessment*\
- **Central & southern zones** show the largest mismatches — indicating
uneven market patterns

> These “hard-to-predict” areas should be prioritized for review in
> future assessment updates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Three Evidence-Based Recommendations

**Review Where the Model Shows the Largest Gaps** → Our residual analysis
pinpoints neighborhoods with the highest prediction errors — the same
areas where assessments are likely least fair. Prioritize these zones
for reassessment and data verification.

**Use the Model as a Fairness Benchmark** → Instead of replacing official
assessments, use the model as a cross-check tool to flag properties with
unusually high or low assessed-to-predicted ratios.

**Institutionalize Annual Model Updates** → Retrain the model each year
using new sales and census data so assessments stay current with real
market trends, preventing future inequities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Limitations & Improvements


**Data gaps**: Some neighborhoods have limited or inconsistent sales data, and important local factors like school quality or public amenities are not fully represented.

**Spatial variation**: The model’s accuracy differs across regions — it performs very well in some areas but less so in others, suggesting that geography strongly influences results.

**Spatial modeling**: Next, we will apply models that explicitly account for spatial relationships and neighborhood effects to improve prediction accuracy.

**Data enhancement**: We plan to expand data coverage in underrepresented areas to reduce bias and strengthen fairness across communities.
